        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yeast - 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast</li>
            <li>White sugar - 1/4 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Water - 3/4 cup</li>
            <li>Flour - 2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Salt - 1/2 teaspoon</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
            <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Add your favorite toppings, and bake. Enjoy!</li>
