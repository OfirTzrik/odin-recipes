            <li><strong>Potatoes</strong> - 4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into strips</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong> - 1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder</strong> - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong> - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li><strong>Ground black pepper</strong> - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong> - 1 cup</li>

            <li><strong>Vegetable oil</strong> - 1 quart</li>
            <li><strong>Cod fillets</strong> - 1.5 pounds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place sliced potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with cold water.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a separate medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add milk and egg; stir until batter is smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Drain and pat dry potatoes. Fry in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Dredge cod in batter, one piece at a time, and place in hot oil.</li>
            <li>Fry fish in batches until golden brown on all sides; drain on paper towels. Monitor oil temperature, increasing the heat as needed to maintain 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry potatoes again in hot oil until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes; drain on paper towels.</li>
        </ol>
